Security is a constant worry when it comes to information technology. Data theft, hacking, malware, and a host of other threats are enough to keep any IT professional up at night.

# Least privilege

The principle of least privilege works by limiting the accessible data, resources, applications and application functions to only that which a user or entity requires to execute their specific task or workflow. Without incorporating the principle of least privilege, you can create over-privileged users or entities that increase the potential for breaches and misuse of critical systems and data.

# Keeping your system up to date

To enhance the security of your validator node, updating your system regularly is key. By keeping your operating system up to date with the latest software patches and security fixes, you can mitigate potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.  

Regular updates ensure that you have access to the most secure versions of software packages and libraries, helping to protect your validator node from known security threats. Remember to check for updates frequently and apply them promptly to stay one step ahead in terms of system security.

# Prepare for the Worst, Plan for the Best

Planning for failure will help minimize its actual consequences should it occur. Ideally, a security system will never be breached, but when a security breach does take place, you need to have a plan and be able to react quickly. This is why it is important to back up and encrypt your sensitive data, such as your validator keys.
