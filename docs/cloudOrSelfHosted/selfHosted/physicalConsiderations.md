Running a node at home is a challenging task, since there are a lot of things that can go wrong, and thus need to be adressed.

# Electricity

This is an obvious point. But sometimes so obvious that you may forget about it.

Your hardware need electricity to run properly. Depending on where you live, you may be subject to power outage, overvoltage or undervoltage. Sometimes, you can even have micro power outages which can damage your hardware.

Do not hesitate to buy an **UPS**, which stands for Uninterruptible Power Supply. This device acts as a power bank, and keep your node running when incoming power is interrupted. While it generally does not last very long, up to a few hours depending on the capacity and the consumption of your node, it will protect you from small power outage.

Additionally, almost all UPSs contain integrated surge protection to shield the output appliances from voltage spikes.

Do not forget to plug your router to the UPS, because if you do not have connectivity, then your node is useless.

# Connectivity

This is as important as electricity. Without connectivity, your node is useless. Downtime can lead to penalties, and you can be slashed for it.  
Some **ISP**, Internet Service Provider, offer a garanty of connectivity, generally in an **SLA**, which stands for Service Level Agreement.  
You need to check available ISPs in your country, and which offers they have.

# Hardware

Your node need some specific requirements, such as storage, RAM, number of cores, etc... These requirements are usually written in the project documentation.  
One may think that it is a better idea to buy old and refurbished hardware than buying a new one, in order to save money.  

Keep in mind that the hardware can become obsolete and stop receiving security patches, like motherboards and processors.  
While it is not compulsory to have bleeding edge hardware, try to always have hardware which is supported and maintained.

# Physical Security

This is an issue that you need to be aware of. When hosting a node at home, there is a small chance, yet still possible, to be exposed to an environmental disaster, like an earthquake, a flood, etc...

# Thieves

What if your house or appartment gets robbed ? It happens more often than you think.  
Unlike cloud provider, your physical location is not secure. Data center are sensible infrastructures and thus protected accordingly, with security measures.
