# Physical considerations

Running a node at home is a challenging task, since there are a lot of things that can go wrong, and thus need to be adressed.

# Electricity

This is an obvious point. But sometimes so obvious that you may forget about it.

Your hardware need electricity to run properly. Depending on where you live, you may be subject to power outage, overvoltage or undervoltage. Sometimes, you can even have micro power outages which can damage your hardware.

Do not hesitate to buy an **UPS**, which stands for Uninterruptible Power Supply. This device acts as a power bank, and keep your node running when incoming power is interrupted. While it generally does not last very long, up to a few hours depending on the capacity and the consumption of your node, it will protect you from small power outage.

Additionally, almost all UPSs contain integrated surge protection to shield the output appliances from voltage spikes.

Do not forget to plug your router to the UPS, because if you do not have connectivity, then your node is useless.
