# Which one is better ?

Should I host my node at home, or in the cloud ?
There is no definitive answer to this question. Each choice has its own advantages and drawbacks, and you need to be aware of the consequences of each choice and act accordingly.

{% hint style="info" %}
Personally, I run my nodes at home, because I prefer to increase the decentralization and to have more control over my hardware

## Self hosted
### Pros
* You are increasing decentralization :
The goal of having a myriad of different configurations is to avoid having a SPOF, which stands for Single Point of Failure. For example, if an important number of validator is located in a single data center, what will happen if there is an electricity outage, our even a natural disaster like a tsunami or an earthquake ? With a lot of validators down, this will harm the network, and potentially halt the chain
* You have complete control over your hardware :
This is clearly an advantage over running your node in the cloud, because you can choose each component of your node independantly. Increase your RAM, your storage capacity... This is way more flexible, since cloud provider generally do not allow this level of granularity.
Cons
* You will have more work to do :
The more control you have, the more responsibilities you have.
Keep in mind that hosting a validator is not an easy taks. This brings a lot of challenges, and some issues that need to be tackled.
* Capital expenditure :
You need to buy your own hardware, and be knowledgable about it. Do I buy this CPU over this one, with this architecture ? Do I buy RAM with ECC, which stands for Error Correction Code ?
It can become costly very quickly, but you just need to pay it once
​
## In the cloud
### Pros
* Less work to do :
You do not have to worry about physical security, hardware, since everything is handled by your cloud provider
* Pay as you go :
Each clearly displayed in your contract with the cloud provider. You get exactly what you pay for, and bills are predictables. 
​
### Cons
* Less control and flexibility :
You can only choose what cloud provider are offering
* Cost in the long run :
In the long term, say 2 or 3 years, it will probably be costlier to host your node in the cloud than hosting it yourself (electricity bill included)
