If you want to host your node in the cloud, here is the list of things to consider.

# Generalities
When choosing a data center, you should basically consider every thing that can fail or broke, and verify if your data center offers redundancy against this issue.

# Data center Tiers
Not all data centers are equal. Some have redunduncy, some not. You need a way to compare and rate data centers. This is what tiers are used for. Data center tiers are a system used to describe specific kinds of data center infrastructure in a consistent way. Tier 1 is the simplest infrastructure, while Tier 4 is the most complex and has the most redundant components. Each tier includes the required components of all the tiers below it.  

Basically, you should look out for at least Tier 3 data center. The higher, the better.

# Checklist
Here is the list of things you should consider:

- Redundant Power
- Redundant Cooling
- Redundant Networking
- Data replication
- Physical Cage/Gated Access
- Remote Alerting Security Camera
- On-site support
- Service Level Agreements (SLAs)
- Reputation
- Location, for data protection (GDRP for EU or CCPA for the US)

# Data centers CAN fail
Data centers are not fault proof. Bad things can happen too. Recently, in March 2021, OVH suffered a large fire at its datacenter in Strasbourg, France.  
An another exemple is a power surge at British Airways data center, which caused flight chaos.

# Colocation
This is a mix between cloud and self hosted. A colocation facility (colo) is a data center in which a business can rent space for servers, storage devices and other computing and networking hardware.

Typically, a colo provides the building, cooling, power supply, voice and data network bandwidth, internet access and physical security, while the customer provides servers, storage and network devices. It can support all or part of an IT infrastructure, ensuring that customer business needs are addressed.
