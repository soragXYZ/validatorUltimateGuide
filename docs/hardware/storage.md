Data storage is the collective methods and technologies that capture and retain digital information on electromagnetic, optical or silicon-based storage media.  

The most known types of storage are HDD and SSD.

# Hard Disk Drive
A hard disk is a circular platter coated with a thin layer of magnetic material. The disk is inserted on a spindle and spins at speeds of up to 15,000 revolutions per minute (rpm). As it rotates, data is written on the disk surface using magnetic recording heads. A high-speed actuator arm positions the recording head to the first available space on the disk, allowing data to be written in a circular fashion.

# Solid State Drive
On most SSDs, data is written to pooled NAND flash chips that use either floating gate cells or charge trap cells to retain their electrical charges. These charges determine the binary bit state. An SSD is not technically a drive but more like an integrated circuit made up of millimeter-sized silicon chips that can contain thousands or even millions of nanotransistors.  

# SSD or HDD
An SSD is usually faster, quieter, and has a longer lifespan than the average HDD. HDDs are prone to fragmentation and failure due to their moving parts. SSDs, as their name implies, are solid devices that are shock resistant and thus more durable. HDDs are more affordable and can often offer more storage capacity.  

Even though HDD are a bit cheaper than SSD and tend to use less energy, we recommand to use SSD because they are faster.  

The rest of this guide assumes that you are going with SSD.  
It is also recommended to have an heatsink on your SSD to extend the drive lifespan.

# Type of SSD
There are a number of different terms used to describe different types of SSDs, such as mSATA or PCIe. To attach an SSD to your system or motherboard, you need to connect it using a specific type of connection interface.

- **PCIe and NVMe SSDs**: PCI Express (PCIe) is normally used to connect graphics cards, network cards, or other high-performance hardware. This interface gives you high bandwidth and low latency, making it ideal when you need super fast communication between an SSD and your CPU/RAM. SSDs that use the PCIe connection type are based on the Nonvolatile Memory Express standard (NVMe), which boasts up to 32 Gbps of raw throughput and runs at up to 7 Gbps.

- **mSATA III, SATA III, and traditional SSDs**: Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA) is an older SSD interface designed specifically for storage, with speeds up to 6 Gbps. SATA is slowly being phased out in favor of NVMe, which is significantly faster.

# Memory type
The method SSDs use to store data on their flash chips has a noticeable impact on speed and longevity. When shopping for an SSD you might notice labels like QLC, TLC or SLC. These stand for the amount of data contained within a single cell of the flash chip:  
- Q for quad means 4
- T for triple means 3
- M for multi means 2
- S for single means 1

TLC, MLC, or SLC drives are recommended, unlike QLC drives. QLC drives are not recommended due to their slower performance and lower total reliability.

# DRAM
SSDs come with or without DRAM, which is a hardware element that makes accessing data on the SSD more efficient. Those with DRAM are faster but those without DRAM are cheaper. However, DRAM is quite important for providing smooth node operation.  

Thus a drive with a DRAM cache is recommended.
