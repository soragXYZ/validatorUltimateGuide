RAM, also known as computer memory, is one of the most vital components.  
RAM is the familiar acronym for random access memory, which is the temporary storage in your computer that gives applications a place to store and access data on a short-term basis. Having more RAM means that more data can be accessed and read almost instantly, as opposed to being written on the hard drive.

# Form factor
For the most part, RAM comes in two sizes:
- DIMM (Dual In-Line Memory Module), which is found in desktops and servers
- SO-DIMM (Small Outline DIMM), which is found in laptops and other small form factor computers

Though the two RAM form factors use the same technology and functionally work exactly the same way, you cannot mix them. You can't just jam a DIMM stick into a SO-DIMM slot, and vice versa (the pins and slots don't line up!).  

When buying RAM, the first thing to figure out is its form factor. Nothing else matters if the stick do not fit.

# DDR denomination
You have probably read the term DDR4 or DDR5. The RAM you use in your computer operates using Double Data Rate (DDR). DDR RAM means that two transfers happen per clock cycle. Newer types of RAM are updated versions of the same technology, hence why RAM modules carry the label of DDR, DDR2, DDR3, and so on.  

While all desktop RAM generations are the same physical size and shape, **they are not compatible**.

You cannot use DDR3 RAM in a motherboard that only supports DDR2. Likewise, DDR3 does not fit in a DDR4 slot. Each RAM generation has a notch cut in the pins at different locations to stop any confusion. That means you cannot accidentally mix your RAM modules up or damage your motherboard, even if you buy the wrong type.

# Clock speed
You may have seen RAM referred to by two sets of numbers, like DDR3-1600 and PC3-12800. These both reference and allude to the generation of the RAM and its transfer speed. The number after DDR/PC and before the hyphen refers to the generation: DDR2 is PC2, DDR3 is PC3, DDR4 is PC4, and DDR5 is PC5.  

The number paired after DDR refers to the number of megatransfers per second (MT/s). For example, DDR3-1600 RAM operates at 1,600MT/s. The DDR5-6400 RAM mentioned above will operate at 6,400MT/s—much faster! The number paired after PC refers to the theoretical bandwidth in megabytes per second.  

You might be wondering if you can mix RAM modules of different clock speeds. The answer is that yes, you can, but they will all run at the clock speed of the slowest module. If you want to use faster RAM, do not mix it with your older, slower modules.  

You can, in theory, mix RAM brands, but it is not advisable. You run a greater chance of encountering random crashes when you mix RAM brands or different RAM clock speeds.

# Timing and latency
You will sometimes see RAM modules with a series of numbers, like 9-10-9-27. These numbers are referred to as timings. A RAM timing is a measurement of the performance of the RAM module in nanoseconds. The lower the numbers, the quicker the RAM reacts to requests.  

The first number is the CAS latency. The CAS latency refers to the number of clock cycles it takes for data requested by the memory controller to become available to a data pin.  

For most people, capacity trumps clock speed and latency every time. You will get much more benefit from 16GB of DDR4-1600 RAM than you get from 8GB of DDR4-2400 RAM. In most cases, timing and latency are the last points of consideration.

# The number of channel
When shopping for RAM, you will see that usually, 2 sticks of 16GB is costlier than 1 stick of 32GB.  
You may think that it is a good idea to save a few bucks and buy only 1 stick of RAM.  

This is **not a good idea**.

RAM sticks communicate with your computer through a series of channels. Single-channel RAM sticks use one 64-bit channel, while dual-channel sticks use two 64-bit channels, totaling 128 bits. When comparing two identical units, dual-channel RAM provides around 15% more speed, which comes from its higher data transfer bandwidth.  

Basically, the higher the number of channel, the better.

# ECC
Error correction code (ECC) memory is a type of RAM memory more commonly found in workstations and servers. It’s valued by professionals and businesses with critical data for its ability to automatically detect and correct memory errors, thus fighting data corruption. It’s also supposed to lead to less crashes of a server / workstation over non-ECC memory.  
Physically, ECC memory differs from non-ECC memory (like what consumer laptop / desktop RAM uses) in that it has 9 memory chips instead of 8 (memory chips are used to store data that is sent to the CPU when summoned). ECC RAM’s bonus memory chip is used for error detection and correction among the other eight memory chips.  
Note that consumer motherboards and processors do not usually support ECC-compatible RAM.
