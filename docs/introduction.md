# The what
Welcome to the all-in-one validator security guide!

The goal of this guide is to walk you through steps you can take to secure your node against malicious actors.  
Whether you're running a local server at home or a VPS server/virtual machine on the cloud, the tips here will help you harden your node against outside attack and help protect it during its lifespan.

# The why
If you are running a node in a mainnet network, then your role is crucial.

Being a validator is not an easy task. You have to constantly keep your node up and running, and take security measures, because otherwise it can jeopardize the security of the network, and/or your personnal stake.  
I wrote this guide because I have had an hard time finding out good documentation related to security or maintenance. You can find multiple advices here and here, but not everything in one place.  
And usually, guides do not explain what is the effect of such security measures, and which issues they adress.  
That's when I thought, ok, let's write one then!

# The who
This guide is aimed at people running a node in a mainnet network. It does not matter if you are an individual or an organisation. You have to take measures to keep your node up and running.
